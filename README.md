# React + Vite

I'm developing in the Front-End, I'm going to work with React, a JavaScript library and at the same time I'll discover Vite. 
I will create the tic-tac-toe game, having approached the components, the rendering, the React.fragment, the props and the hook useState.

ENJOY THE GAME!

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
